== Introduction
Wayback Image Restorer is a Python tool for retrieving archived images from the Wayback Machine with preserved folder structures.

== Features
* Retrieves archived URLs while maintaining folder structures
* Adaptive rate limiting with exponential backoff
* Accepts configurable command-line arguments

== Prerequisites
* Python 3.13+
* `pip` for dependency management
* `waybackpy` and `requests` libraries

== Design Considerations
* **Rate Limiting:** 5–7 seconds per request, with a 30–60 second break every 15 downloads.
* **Failure Handling:** Exponential backoff, with a 10-minute pause after 3 consecutive failures.
* **CLI Interface:** Uses `argparse` for command-line options.
* **Logging Indicators:**
** ✅ Success
** ❌ Failure
** ⚠️ Warning
