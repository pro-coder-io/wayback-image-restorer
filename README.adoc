== Introduction

Wayback Image Restorer is a Python tool designed to retrieve archived images from the Wayback Machine, ideal for restoring lost website assets.

== Features

* Retrieves archived URLs while preserving folder structures.
* Implements adaptive rate limiting with exponential backoff.
* Accepts configurable command-line arguments.

== Prerequisites

* Python 3.13+
* `pip` for dependency management
* `waybackpy` and `requests` libraries

== Installation

. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pro-coder-io/wayback-image-restorer.git
cd wayback-image-restorer
```
. Create a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv pyenv
source pyenv/bin/activate
```
. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

== Usage

. Run the script with a base URL:
```
./restore-images https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/*
```

== Design Considerations

* **Rate Limiting:** 5–7 seconds per request, with a 30–60 second break every 15 downloads.
* **Failure Handling:** Exponential backoff with a 10-minute pause after 3 consecutive failures.
* **CLI Interface:** Uses `argparse` for command-line options.
* **Logging:** Emoji-based status indicators.
