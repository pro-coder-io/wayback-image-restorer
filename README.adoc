== Introduction
Wayback Image Restorer is a Python tool that downloads archived images from the Wayback Machine based on a user-defined base URL pattern. This project was designed to help restore missing image assets from a WordPress site using data preserved on web.archive.org.

== Features
- Fetches archived URLs from the Wayback Machine.
- Downloads images to a local directory with preserved paths.
- Implements adaptive rate limiting to avoid triggering blocks.
- Supports retries with exponential backoff.
- Configurable via command-line arguments.

== Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `waybackpy` and `requests` libraries

== Installation
. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gregturn/wayback-image-restorer.git
   cd wayback-image-restorer
   ```
. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv pyenv
   source pyenv/bin/activate
   ```
. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

== Usage
Run the script with a specified base URL:
```bash
./restore-images https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/*
```

== Design Considerations
=== Rate Limiting and Backoff
- *Initial Wait Time:* 5-7 seconds between requests.
- *Normal Wait Time:* 5-7 seconds once stable.
- *Break Every 15 Downloads:* 30-60 seconds pause to avoid triggering Wayback Machine rate limits.
- *Failure Handling:* Exponential backoff and a 10-minute pause after 3 consecutive failures.

=== Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Introduced argument parsing using `argparse`.
- Removed hard-coded base URL, making the script more reusable.

=== Logging and Feedback
- ASCII icons for status: ✅ success, ❌ failure, ⚠️ warning.
- Prints detailed logs for each download attempt and retry.
